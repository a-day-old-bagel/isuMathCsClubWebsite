Visiting Assitant Professor Briana Foster-Greenwood brought the materials and provided guidance on how to fold these stars.</li>
						<li>We also got an update about the SMERF talks from the president. He said time has been very scarce, between midterms and mounds of homework, but that the club should still be able to hold one talk this semester. He will continue working on this to make sure it happens.</li>

								<li>The presentation length will be 3 speakers, each presenting for approximately 10 minutes each.</li>
								<li>We also discussed the possibility of recording the talks and posting them to YouTube.</li>
								<li>Jacob reached out to other math related clubs about the possibility of getting some speakers, but he has not heard back yet from any of them.</li>
								<li>Some other possible speakers in the spring would be the Math Modeling contest particpants.</li>
								<li>There was heated debate about the name for these talks, but SMERF talks won out over TATER Talks.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Science and Engineering Festival in the Spring</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Jacob updated the club about his progress on the Sound of Numbers program he is working on, where the children would be able to type in numbers and functions, and then have them converted into musical notes.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Mathematics Board</li>
							<ul>
								<li>We discussed the need to get the board updated, possibly doing so during an upcoming club meeting.</li>

						<li>We started off by dicussing plans for the annual Career Panel. Some possible places to hold it included the Portneuf Brewery and College Market. We also discussed what researc areas we would like to have speakers discuss, which included:
						<ul>
							<li>Actuarial work</li>
							<li>Nuclear engineering research</li>
							<li>Cybersecurity research.</li>
						</ul>
						 If have a specific area you would like discussed, please contact us and we'll see if we can arrange that.</li>
						<li>We then discussed the possibility of holding a campus-wide programming competition, possibly offering a scholarship for the winner.</li>
						<li> Our main point of discussion at this meeting was of a regular evening lecture series, designed to get undergraduates interested and partcipating in math and science related fields. Some key characteristics include:
							<ul>
								<li>Collaboration with other clubs and majors to get speakers for these interdisciplinary talks.</li>
								<li>The talks must relate to mathematics in some way.</li>
								<li>The tentative title of these talks is the University Conversation Hour (UCH).</li>
								<li>The target audience would be 100 to 200 level students.</li>
							</ul>
						<li> We also discussed the clubs purpose, which is to get people to be less "afraid" of and more interested in mathematics.</li>
						<li>We also discussed club dues, which are $5 for full membership for the year. Please pay the treasurer, Orlando.</li>

We are taking movie ideas to compile and vote on for one of the next couple meetings. (Claire suggests Tron) ;)</li><li>This year we are also trying to do a slightly stronger recruiting push in both the Math and CS areas.</li>
</ol><div>We had quite a few people show up at yesterday's meeting, but no new faces. The officers for the year are Jeremy Farrell as President, Claire Chow as Vice-President/Public Relations, and myself as Secretary/Web Maintenance.  Jeremy and myself will be splitting the Treasurer responsibilities. Also, Dr. Derryberry is the new faculty advisor for the club this year. If anybody else has anything else to add to this, please feel free to reply to the mailman list.  I will be posting these minutes on the website, and I will be working to keep the website up to date and accurate. That being said, if anyone sees a discrepancy on the webpage (give me a couple days to work on it), please email me.  Otherwise, let's make this a great year for the club, and a great year for everyone's academics!</div>

				</p>
				<p>
					Friday, September 09, 2011
				</p>
				<p>
					Erik suggested a possible activity - an iterated Prisoners dilemma contest.
				</p>
				<p>
					Folks in Computer Science and Economics could be particularly interested in this activity. Faculty members Greg Green (who teaches game theory) and Philosophy lecturer William McCurdy might be  especially interested in helping boost this activity.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Laser Tag (and miniature golf) event - Outer limits:
				</p>
				<p>
					Some ground rules
				</p>
				<p>
					i) Food costs should be split proportionate to club size with all food shared.
					<br />
					ii) Each club handles the tickets for their regular members in whatever manner they choose.
					<br />
					iii) Newbees/recruits pay their own way, but get free food , all clubs splitting the cost equally.
					<br />
					iv) Program setting should be set to focus on hunting rather than "capture the flag" and to discourage "farming the base".
					<br />
					v) All should try to be there by 5:45 Friday September 23 to register.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					What to say at recruiting
				</p>
				<p>
					General comments about Math/CS club- we meet every other week, we often have pizza or snacks. Some of our big events are movies and a career panel. This Friday (September 23) we will have a Laser  tag/miniature golf event at the Outer Limit from 6:30 - 7:30. Registration at 5:45. This will be a joint event with the Chemistry, Physics, and Economics clubs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although you must pay for your own ticket ( $10), free food will be provided by the clubs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recruitment schedule
				</p>

				<p>
					Linear Algebra: 10 am Jeremy; 11 am : Claire
				</p>
				<p>
					Calc 3: 1 pm(?) Garrett; 7pm Dr. D
				</p>
				<p>
					326: Garrett
				</p>
				<p>
					*Michael McGregor agreed to cover this class because he is in it. In addition to any of these classes we are specifically targeting feel free to talk to any of your classes that are Math or CS  related. 
					<br />
					Also anyone that is planning on coming please email (<a href="mailto:farrjere@isu.edu">farrjere@isu.edu</a>) me by Wednesday September 21, 2011.
